# Analysis of road safety in England
The primary objectives of the exploratory analysis encompassed the identification of distinct patterns within casualty demographics, the discernment of correlations between local authorities and accident occurrences, a focused examination of incidents involving fatalities or serious injuries (KSIs), and the revelation of prevailing trends concerning pedestrian KSIs. Through a comprehensive examination of road safety data pertaining to England, these objectives were achieved by delving into the dynamics of pedestrian fatalities and severe injuries, investigating the socio-demographic composition of accident-involved populations, and scrutinizing trends within local authorities in relation to casualties. By leveraging analytical tools such as Excel, R, and Python, a thorough assessment was conducted, followed by the effective communication of findings to stakeholders, aimed at facilitating well-informed decision-making. The ultimate aim was to propose actionable measures that could potentially contribute to a substantial 30% reduction in accident-related fatalities, thereby bolstering overall road safety in England.
